jungle.intro.raka1=HA! Why's this ball still with us!? Someone get it outta me righ' now!
jungle.intro.mia1=Despite this orb being a mild annoyance, what I would like to be freed first and foremost is from the donkey that is raising my hackles. 
jungle.intro.raka2=Cuz ya think I ain't fed up with ya, filthy snake!?
jungle.intro.mia2=Huh... Fortunately, we are going to find Alan Moggycian soon. Otherwise, I might become mad as a hornet.
jungle.intro.raka3=Heh, you bet! T'think the blue toad wanted to send us to the Antillopes archipelago... It'd take days t'go to that one-horse place!
jungle.intro.mia3=Anyway, following blindly this fluorescent thing was out of the question. There surely was something fishy with this proposition. With no doubt, the treatment of Alan Moggycian, whose reputation as a healer precedes him, will surely prove itself to be the optimal solution.
jungle.intro.raka4=... Eh, for that, we'd first have to search this ruined temple. Come on, stop speakin' and move, filthy snake!
jungle.intro.mia4=Kss-kss... I hope this donkey can also be tight as a clam sometimes.
