boss.intro.raka1=Ha... Ha ha ha! Y've all been fleeced, you dogs!
boss.intro.mia1=Kss-kss... As if it were a reason to be proud as a peacock. But it's true that there are a lot of traps within this temple... How could our enemies place so many of them in such a short amount of time?
boss.intro.alan1=These dogs are not the ones you should thank for this.
boss.intro.alan2=These traps are needed to repel the soldiers of Crabcassonne. Ten years ago, when their army invaded our gorgeous city, the Chokittyrao, all the felines ran away as fast as cheetahs. As for myself, to let our sacred temple fall into the hands of these rats was inconceivable.
boss.intro.raka2=... Ya really stayed in that dump for ten years?
boss.intro.mia2=Kss-kss... If you are the only one here, might you know where Alan Moggycian is?
boss.intro.alan3=... Meow? I am Alan Moggycian.
boss.intro.raka3=... Thought ya'd be smaller.
boss.intro.mia3=... Anyway, let's return to our muttons. We need your healing skills.
boss.intro.raka3=That blue toad put that fishy ball between us ! I had to put up with that filthy snake for days because of that mystic link!
boss.intro.mia3=Kss-kss... You are lucky you do not have to bear yourself, donkey.
boss.intro.rakagrr=*grrrr*
boss.intro.miagrr=*grrrr*
boss.intro.alan4=Mufufu... Could that be the source of the energy I can sense from you two?
boss.intro.raka4=Heh? I don't understand what yer sayin' at all . Hurry up and take that thin' out!
boss.intro.alan5=No need to have kittens, there is nothing to get worked up about. Solving this case is very simple. Here, come closer...
boss.intro.raka5=What was that!? Why am I feelin' weeker!?
boss.intro.mia4=Kss-kss... I knew it was way too easy.
boss.intro.alan6=Mufufu... You should know that no one can believe a cat if there is fish for meal. Your energy will be mine, even though it shall entail the end of your futile lives.
boss.intro.alan7=I can already feel the power growing within me... By absorbing it all, I would make mincemeat of those dogs from Crabcassonne! Do not try to resist. The cat will get your tongue! Meow!
